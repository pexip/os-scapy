Note that the python3-scapy package is built by src:scapy3k. There is no
unified codebase that supports both Python 2 and Python 3 due to the extensive
use of bytearrays.

This package uses quilt in order to apply patches to the upstream source.  
Patches are stored in debian/patches. For further details, see the man page for 
quilt.
